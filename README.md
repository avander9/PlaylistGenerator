# Playlist Generator  
  
This script enables the creation of M3U playlists for video files within a specified directory. The script scans the provided directory for video files (with common extensions like .mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov) and generates a playlist file (playlist.m3u) containing the relative paths of these video files.  

How to Use:  

Save the script in the same directory as your video files or provide the full path to the script. Open a terminal and execute the script by providing the target directory.

Example:  

    python playlistGenerator.py /path/to/video/files  

  
Upon execution, the script creates a playlist file (playlist.m3u) in the specified directory, simplifying the organization and playback of your video content.
